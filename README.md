# cTab-msg-notification

Credits to the original cTab Team, Riouken, Gundy and Raspu86.
Special thanks for CrimzonKat and Cannon from the Legion Studios team for helping me understand Arma Event Handlers

This mod's purpose is to override the normal msg recieve from cTab to send the user a notification with the sender and body of the message.
